It seems that there was a great deal more recall errors than there were precision errors from my deduplication. 

The fields I used for comparison were price, title, and manufacturer. The comparatorfor price extracted numbers and comapred those. The comparator for manufacturer checked for equality, and if a field is a substring of the other field. The title comparator I originally wrote was based off Levenstein string distance.
